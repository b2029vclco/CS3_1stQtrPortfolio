## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

    1. Arithmetic Operators - A topic discussed was arithmetic operators. This were used to do operations with variables. Examples are the + symbol, the - symbol, the ++ symbol, the * symbol, the / symbol, the modulo symbol, and many more. 

    2. Variable Declaration - A topic discussed was variable declaration. You can declare variables with keywords "var" and "let". Keyword "const" can be used if you want the variables to not be changed.

    3. If statement - A topic discussed was the if statement. You enter a boolean expression, and if the result is true, the code inside the if statement is done. Otherwise, it will do nothing unless you have an else statement, that will execute code if the boolean statement is false.

    4. While loop - A loop discussed was the while loop. You have to have a variable, that will run through a boolean expression. Remember to iterate, or else you risk having an infinite loop. 

    5. For loop - A loop also discussed was the for loop. You declare a variable, then you run it through a boolean expression. What makes it different from a while loop is that this loop automatically iterates.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

    1. Functions - A topic I still have slight difficulty understanding is Functions. You can execute blocks of code repeatedly when you call them. Sometimes, I still have trouble declaring them.

    2. Hyperlink - I have slight trouble with hyperlinks. This is because even if I know what these are, which are links to websites that can be represented by images and text, I have a hard time remembering the correct syntax for them. I should try to use them more when I code.

    3. External Source - An external source is when you use other files in your html or javascript file. I haven't exactly used this much. Therefore, the syntax for me is foggy.

    4. Data Types - When they tell me to add 5 + "3", I always answer 8. This is wrong. The answer is 53, as the combination of number and string brings a result of 53.

    5. Input - I don't really use the input function much. This will usually get info from the user, through keyword "prompt". I don't use this much, so I'm not sure of the syntax.


## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

    My plan is to code more. Code about more problems, and use the Native functions I don't know. Use more functions, more hyperlinks, external sources, and the "prompt" keyword more. I can also study for Data Types, as the more I code, the more I will learn about these through my experiences.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

    The first that I think was effective in helping me learn about booleans and the result of expressions is kahoot games. Kahoot games made me competitive, and want to learn and do better, so when I was right outside the top 3, I wanted to work harder and learn, and I reviewed the Kahoots. The second one is the graded coding exercises. There is a difference between just memorizing terms and actually learning how to code. It helps reinforce what we study, help with coding logic, and help us to use the syntax more. 2 more ineffective activities are the non-graded exercises because no one actually bothers to do them. Another ineffective exercise is the recitation as no one really pays attention.
