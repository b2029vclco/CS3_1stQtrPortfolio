# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
## **by Varick Co of 9-Cesium**
### 1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting

   - I found it interesting that rice is only 20 pesos per kilo now.
   - I was pleased to hear that there will be free college education.
   - I think it was good that dialysis will be free.


### 2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)

   - little to no explanation about the ARAL program
   - no explanation on how the government is building and improving lifestyles, where do they get the money?

### 3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

I was really intrigued by what president Bong Bong Marcos had to say in his SONA 2025. During his SONA 2025, he made multiple announcements that the government of the Philippines. He talked about the food and water, getting cheaper and being supplied to new areas. He also talked about planting roughly a million coconut seeds. He also talks about building more power plants to power new homes. 

He talked about making more hospitals and transportation like the Love Bus, and he talked about improving Filipino education. But, although these claims sound true, we don't know how much of what he says is true. It could just be lies and pointless promises. We should hope that what he said was true, and try our best to also improve the Philippines in our own way, through our studies or jobs.



### 4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?
Good luck to the Philippines!
